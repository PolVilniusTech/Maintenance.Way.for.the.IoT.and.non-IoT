<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >In the Official Portal of the <a 
href="https://www.huawei.com" >HUAWEI</a> You have chance to get hands on
&#8221;E5573B Quick Start-(E5573Bs-322,01,en).pdf&#8221; Guide (following - Online
Documentation).<br />
Online Documentation are newer comparing with Documentation which would come
with the Product from e.Shop.<br />
In the Online Documentation are given Tips for Troubleshooting which are not given
with a Product E5573.<br />
Online Documentation does not provide &#8221;Safety Information&#8221; chapter. Product
E5573 Documentation at least comes with no less than 22 translations to various
languages including language of Republic of Lithuania. Online Documentation does
not provide translations, so it would be wise to keep the Docs.
</p><!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >According provided Privacy Policy in URL: <a 
href="http://consumer.huawei.com/privacy-policy" >HUAWEI Privacy Policy</a> there are
situations when it would need to register at Huawei with &#8221;Huawei ID&#8221; and provide
following information: first name, last name, e.mail, mobile phone no., info of Your
request, shipping address and payment method. Privileges are given to use Document
Storage in the &#8221;Cloud&#8221; Solution. In this case Huawei would be responsible for
securing Your provided information.<br />
In the Privacy Policy (I. chapter) there is something as the Company are in need for
&#8221;executing requirements according of some jurisdictions in need to detect user
identities of the user accounts in live and non-stop fashion&#8221;, so depending by
non-listed jurisdictional document they are doing this for everyone. Listed
need to fight with electronical (entertainment) games addiction. Listed need
to meet the requirements to conduct successful online shop purchases. In
these cases for the Consumer would be necessary to provide to the HUAWEI
per Person authentic and unique &#8221;Identification Documents&#8221; which ofthen
possible to create in Migration Service and (or) e.Service in the Country. For
talking about the addresses - there would be actual address (where You
live) and declared address (where Person register that he lives in some City.
Registrations usualy are done in one Department of the City. The Mayor in
this case from the Country would get more Money per real Person, so more
Income to the City the better probably would be for everyone). The Biggest
Problem as same for the &#8221;Voting&#8221; situations, the Person should be declared
his living place in One City and not in many Cities. The &#8221;Ghost&#8221; Citizen
sometimes seen in some Cities in the People&#8217;s Republic of China and that&#8217;s
not effective and sustainable at all. Who gonna care for these Buildings
                                                                  

                                                                  
Life-Cycle?<br />
In the Privacy Policy (IX. chapter) there are displayed situation how in abroad of the
the People&#8217;s Republic of China Huawei has control of e.Shop(s) which should
meet the number of requirements in their location specific jurisdictional
requirements, so they would take care for private information in particular of their
jurisdictional rules. This is sample of &#8221;Introduction&#8221; and these requirements
should be found in each of those e.Shops. This could be called as Distributed
documentation approach. In centralised approach there would be given a list of each
e.Shop website address and (or) oher contacts, URL link from where You
would directly be linked to the right place. Only questions for the Customer
Service, if they are decantralised too or not, but usually there is a way to
distribute calls to their right location. Risks of course there are a lot, i.e.
&#8221;Man-in-the-Middle&#8221; attack for example: DNS service does not use DNSSEC so
sameone could poison-inject false information and nowadays even in the
Video Stram would be possible to do so. Techniques are linked with the
term of the &#8221;Propaganda&#8221;. Russians loves this one, but the word &#8221;Pagan&#8221;
in this word means &#8221;(historical) local resident&#8221; which does not have ties
with any of (the European) Church(es). In this way they would be shown in
negative colours. I don&#8217;t have alternative knowledge of the better term for &#8221;the
Propaganda&#8221;.<br />
These cases when regular shops is way modern than online shopping and the
difference lies only in the location of purchase (local, international) and the Age of
Person. In this case, we could argue that there are not named the regulations about
weapons and military equipment or being against criminal/brutal activity and it
Services and (or) their transportation and so. This is a big blow to the &#8221;legal acts&#8221;
Side, if their Sources and (or) Documents: (1) does not provide online access to
act information, (2) from provided information there could be done very
different interpretations, (3) there are no &#8221;begin&#8221; and &#8221;end&#8221; time of these
documents, (4) there are no direct and safe link to the newest version of the
document. For further development would be required the access with usage of
data-unique (i.e. Identification No. without duplicates) item and (or) device which
would be providen by True Identity Authority with real Privileges to do so.
And last one, what Huawei already good at, the number of translations in
different actual languages for those documentations. If those points would be
met, then there would be no shame to list these regulations by their real
names.<br />
In general &#8221;Identification Documents&#8221; are requested by other e.Services
too, i.e. github.com has something like that for approving real identity of
Educators. In this case, there should be suggested to proceed request to
the Education organisation directly and the Educator himself could press
the button or just click to approve himself. Such insecure wave of personal
&#8221;Identification Document&#8221; path would be skipped. Now let&#8217;s take the Public and
Private Sector and their Employees, because they need to look for the Job
too, so in Modern Age, this could be used in many Situations and in many
Ways.<br />
It&#8217;s a Shame on e.Services nowadays, especially from Organisational Standpoint.
                                                                  

                                                                  
Unfortunately, no one cares for Security until someone finds the problem, so
Technical Standpoint requires some Cybersecurity knowledge in it.<br />
<a 
href="http://consumer.huawei.com/" >HUAWEI</a> according <a 
href="https://www.urlvoid.com/" >URLVoid</a> has some ties with Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Internet

European Union. Domain is active from the Year of 2000. Domain registered by
Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. Guangdong CN. Additional Information of &#8221;DNSSEC:
unsigned&#8221;. More: <a

Provided statement - &#8221;This device may be operated in all member states of the EU&#8221;.

enforced only single <a

E5573Cs-322 everything is OK.

<!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-100003.1"></a>Web Admin Panel</h4>
<!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >Access to Web Admin Panel Available from Wireless Network Side Only.<br />
                                                                  

                                                                  
Wireless Network by default are set to &#8221;WPA2-PSK&#8221;. Selection for &#8221;None (Open)&#8221; is
Available in the WLAN Basic Settings. The Option of &#8221;WEP&#8221; is Available
too.<br />
Web Admin Panel instead of helpful information per menu provides Professional
Mobile WiFi &#8221;Help&#8221; User Manual.<br />
Web Admin Panel provides Statistical information about Data Stream Volume per
Connection, Monthly Data and Total Data. It also let us see the Time for how
long it were Active. From (Authenticated) User Input there is possible to
define &#8221;Start date&#8221; (wrong), &#8221;Monthly data plan&#8221; (ok), Threshold (ok).
From Documentation perspective it sounds that &#8221;Threshold&#8221; controls only
appearance in the &#8221;Statistic&#8221; Page. The &#8221;Start date&#8221; represents the single
day of the Month from when the Data Plan should be start to do actual
counting.<br />
It&#8217;s cool that Session Identificator for the Web Admin Panel is set to &#8221;httpOnly&#8221; and
after specific Time Users are getting log out for being idle or by inactivity. The
problem with &#8221;httpOnly&#8221; attribute is when You start Sniffing the Data Traffic there
would be Session Identificator presented unencrypted. Some tech could not even
know about such attribute as &#8221;httpOnly&#8221;, so when using HTTPS it still would be
provided unencrypted. In other hand Web Admin Panel does not provide possibility
to the HTTPS in the first place by responding &#8221;Unable to connect&#8221; for URL: <a 
href="https://192.168.8.1/html/home.html" >the
Home Page</a><br />
Web Admin Panel has manual &#8221;Update&#8221; way. In the menu &#8221;Update&#8221; it shows
&#8221;Software version&#8221; and &#8221;Web UI version&#8221; of the instrument E5573Cs. It would be
cooler than that, if in addition of this information alongside would provide
information which is Available from Online Sources, so You would not need to Click
the Button &#8221;Check for updates&#8221;, if there is no reason for that. In other hand there
should exist dynamic notification in the Web Page, if the Update from the Official
API Source is Available.<br />
Web Admin Panel Login Form accepts only password with &#8221;maxlength&#8221; of 15
(fifteen). This is the Problem. Nowdays of course would be more wise to suggest
authentication using Ubikeys or some sort of certificate authentication using Your
own Storage Device.<br />
From HTML perspective there are compliance with no less than HTML4 version. No
&#8221;title&#8221; HTML tag defined. There are some CSRF tokens who protects the device
from negative effects from the &#8221;outside&#8221; while People are surfing through the
Net.<br />
Web Admin Panel are using 1.7.2 jQuery (2012-03-21). According the Year which are
provided in the User Guide &#8221;Copyright&#8221; statement of 2018 there should be already
3.3 Version of jQuery Available.<br />
From Web Admin Panel it could be assumed that Support library for Security
&#8221;OpenSSL&#8221; is not used. From the Year of 2022 &#8221;OpenSSL&#8221; already has 3rd Major
version. All Protective means in Web Admin Panel are implemented using
JavaScript.<br />
Best of the Information provided for common device would be data about
&#8221;OPEN&#x02D9;SOURCE&#x02D9;SOFTWARE&#x02D9;NOTICE&#8221; and the &#8221;Warranty Disclaimer&#8221;.<br />
