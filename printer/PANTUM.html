</p><!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >For testing out the printer were taken good for IoT small-medium Computer
device Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (following - RPi). With the printer comes all the
Apps and Drivers in one small CD. This is the First Problem - the CD DVD
burner-reader, because this small size Computer normally does not need such
functionality. Attaching external CD-DVD reader to RPi made Small RPi
Monitor to blink repeatedly. For this way helps that Pantum Company has
Internet Portal. In the https://global.pantum.com were luck to find something
for &#8221;Linux&#8221; based systems.
</p><!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10">The Problem </span>Web Site Portal does not provide File Integrity Protection for
Downloads, at least MD5 sums, so it does not possible to approve Successful
downloads. [File Integrity]

three connection modes) and macOS perspective only. Provided Compitability
of the Product with: * Microsoft Windows (32/64 Bit) * macOS * Linux *
iOS/Android * NeoKylin (Loongson) Last one does not appear in the e.Shop
specs list. The problem of non existent Market are probable. I&#8217;m approving
that Available Linux drivers has &#8221;(32/64 Bit)&#8221; option, but such information in
the Guidance is lacking.

</p><!--l. 60--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10">Firmware Upgrades Available </span>By look of the Firmware the Basic
&#8221;printer&#8221; are based on MacOS, so it should be Unix based system. And it
should be more similar to Linux based systems than Windows system. For
Windows-to-Linux Way, of course, Windows has &#8221;wsl2&#8221; functionality to
provide Linux functionality only if owner has right instrument-equipment with
appropriate technical specs. It would be resources costly solution. Firmware
does not seem to contain any End User License Agreement and (or) the
Privacy Policy.

class="cmbx-10">Web Admin Panel</span>
</p><!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >Access to Web Admin Panel Available from Wired Network and Wireless
Network Side. Wireless Network by default are set to &#8221;WPA2 Personal&#8221;.
Selection for &#8221;No Authentication&#8221; is Available in the Settings.
</p><!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >Web Admin Panel (or Control Panel Interface) does not seem to contain any
End User License Agreement and (or) the Privacy Policy. [EULA] [Privacy]
</p><!--l. 77--><p class="noindent" >Web Admin Panel (following - CPI) could be accessed using the Web Browser
who are able to process the HTML4 + JQuery (JS based). By turning off the
JS probably effective connectivity and (or) control with the CPI would be cut
off. [HTML]
</p><!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >CPI displays the copyright from the Year of 2015.
</p><!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >CPI could be accessed by HTTP and by HTTPS (Self-signed Certificate from
2019-09-11 EES). [HTTP and HTTPS at the same time] OpenSSL library are
used for generation of Certs. No Licenses Available of third party libraries. [No
Licenses]
</p><!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" >CPI Only allows single Admin Account with username as &#8221;admin&#8221;. No
additional Security Options shown for protecting the Admin Account. [Single
Login] Input Security - data input are controled-cleaned with help of Dynamic
JS. Idea for the Consumer by himself to be able specify further-additional
constraints, i.e. if Phone No. has Protection of &#8221;...&#8221;, then Consumer may wish
to make it more strict to specific format.
</p><!--l. 88--><p class="noindent" >JS in CPI does not have unified-consistant checks for end user (or Consumer)
&#8221;Browser&#8221; Program, i.e. &#8221;navigator.appName;&#8221; &#8221;navigator.appVersion;&#8221;
&#8221;navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf(&#8217;safari&#8217;)&#8221;

</p><!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >By look at Ref. https://www.w3schools.com/js/js&#x02D9;window&#x02D9;navigator.asp best
option would be to check &#8221;navigator.userAgent&#8221; and get all the needed data
from there. When there exists Internet full of Open Source Browser Apps, the
data in &#8221;navigator.appName&#8221; and &#8221;navigator.appVersion&#8221; are not releable
Option at all, unless if there would be some ISO Standard who would link
specific Company Program to Specific App Name. Nowadays we have a lot of
Standard Offering Companies too, so more easiest example could be Specific
Community maintained Database which would have/has support by most of
specific &#8221;Browser&#8221; App Creators.
</p><!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >JS code would be more safe, if there would be centralised checks like in
previous reference, i.e.: navigator.cookieEnabled; navigator.javaEnabled();
navigator.onLine; what about other technologies/pre-processors/current
status?
</p><!--l. 101--><p class="noindent" >Strange Things would be to find something like following (in JS code):
&#8221;[S(&#8221;&#8220;WEP1&#8220;&#8221;), 0]&#8221; &#8221;[S(&#8221;&#8220;WEP2&#8220;&#8221;), 1]&#8221; &#8221;[S(&#8221;&#8220;WEP3&#8220;&#8221;), 2]&#8221;
&#8221;[S(&#8221;&#8220;WEP4&#8220;&#8221;), 3]&#8221; Parallel understanding via different languages (EN,
Chinese...) and security functionality and technologies in Practice are in
Question? WEP is less secure than WPA, WPA2. WEP is more secure that No
Authentication. WEP currently could not be selected via CPI. If there were
official WEP update in more secure option, then I would wish to have for such
knowledge.
</p><!--l. 112--><p class="noindent" >CPI is Powered by jQuery of First Major version 1.X. According ref.
https://releases.jquery.com/jquery/ there are already Third Major version 3.X
[jQuery]
</p><!--l. 114--><p class="noindent" >CPI from Admin Settings allows to reset CPI into Factory Defaults.
</p><!--l. 116--><p class="noindent" >Wired Network in automatic fashion sets up only IPv4, but there should be
way to set up IPv6 too. [Set Up of IPv6]
</p><!--l. 118--><p class="noindent" >Each Query of CPI expires in the Past as &#8221;Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT&#8221;.
Server in Responses provides Cache Setting as &#8221;no-cache&#8221; for the Browser to
comply. [Bad Practice]
</p><!--l. 121--><p class="noindent" >CPI does not use Security Measures like HTTP Strict Transport Security,
Public Key Pinning, Content Security Policy. [Security Headers]
</p><!--l. 123--><p class="noindent" >CPI are providing twelve (12) choises for language selection. Idea for the
Consumer to provide these languages as set of two values where first would be
shown in Original language as in current situation and for second one -
according default locale and (or) some Admin Setting. [Idea]
</p><!--l. 125--><p class="noindent" >CPI has good Security Option for letting Consumers to prolong their CPI&#8217;s
Security of the HTTPS protocol by generating new Self-signed Certs. If we are
taking in the Account that Self-signed Certificate valid not earlier than
2019-09-11 EES, then after around up to 4-5 Years from this date using
&#8221;Public-Key: (2048 bit)&#8221; Certificate would be good to conduct-issue new Cert.
Unfortunately there no Option to choose &#8221;Public-Key: (4096 bit)&#8221; which could
be valid a bit longer. [OpenSSL]
</p><!--l. 129--><p class="noindent" >And a lil more. [2nd and 3rd Idea]

</p><!--l. 138--><p class="noindent" >&#8212;File Integrity&#8212; Linux/Unix has sha256sum file command. Windows
provides &#8221;CRC SHA&#8221; calculator for these Checksums. &#8212;Set Up of IPv6&#8212; -
&#8212;OpenSSL&#8212; - Last version of OpenSSL officialy maintained are 1.1.1, which
were released in 2018-09-11.

class="cmbx-10">Documentation and Regulations</span>
</p><!--l. 144--><p class="noindent" >&#8212;EULA&#8212; - &#8212;Privacy&#8212; - &#8212;No Licenses&#8212; - it helps a lil bit better to hide
the structure of the Program / Libraries. It does not help to give advices.
</p><!--l. 148--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10">Way it would be better</span>
</p><!--l. 150--><p class="noindent" >&#8212;HTTP and HTTPS at the same time&#8212; Let choose for the User to turn off
not needed Option. &#8212;HTML&#8212; from 2014-10-28 should be offered to migrate
into HTML5. &#8212;jQuery&#8212; from 2014-01-24 should be offered to migrate into
Second version of jQuery. &#8212;Bad Practice&#8212; Setting Expiration in the Past is
not good Practice. Of course it would look more Environment Friendly, if for
Computers does not need Small Battery for the Internal Clock functionality.
Via Internet and (or) via specific Satellite module the Clock could be updated,
if the Power Supply Available and Charging. &#8212;Security Headers&#8212; HTTP
Strict Transport Security Available from 2012-11-19, Public Key Pinning
Available/Deprecated. I. Does it would boost the Security, if the Certs anyway
are Auto-generated? II. Does Human error is relevant for Auto-generated
Certs?, Content Security Policy Available from 2012-11-15.

</p><!--l. 158--><p class="noindent" >&#8212;Single Login&#8212; Usually in some Linux distributions You are able to create
more than one Admin Accounts and for this case such &#8221;Single Login&#8221; would
be Disabled for Log In Option. All for making &#8221;Brute Force&#8221; Login Attack less
useful. Pantum let&#8217;s to &#8221;Restore Factory Defaults&#8221; easily, so it would be better
Option to provide Secure Audit Log for Active Logins into the CPI. &#8212;Idea&#8212;
Various systems already allows to set up some local language parameter, so
that&#8217;s nothing new. &#8212;2nd and 3rd Idea&#8212; Common UNIX Printing System
(CUPS) print server with it own web-based administration interface. Ref.
