</p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-100003.1"></a>Web Admin Panel</h4>
<!--l. 88--><p class="noindent" >Access to Web Admin Panel Available from Wired Network and Wireless Network
Side.<br />
Wireless Network by default are set to &#8221;WPA2 Personal&#8221;. Selection for &#8221;No
Authentication&#8221; is Available in the Settings.<br />
Web Admin Panel (or Control Panel Interface) does not seem to contain any End
User License Agreement and (or) the Privacy Policy. [EULA] [Privacy]<br />
Web Admin Panel (following - CPI) could be accessed using the Web Browser who
are able to process the HTML4 + JQuery (JS based).<br />
By turning off the JS probably effective connectivity and (or) control with the CPI
would be cut off. [HTML]<br />
CPI displays the copyright from the Year of 2015.<br />
CPI could be accessed by HTTP and by HTTPS (Self-signed Certificate from
2019-09-11 EES). [HTTP and HTTPS at the same time]<br />
OpenSSL library are used for generation of Certs. No Licenses Available of third
party libraries. [No Licenses]<br />
CPI Only allows single Admin Account with username as &#8221;admin&#8221;. No additional
Security Options shown for protecting the Admin Account. [Single Login]<br />
Input Security - data input are controled-cleaned with help of Dynamic JS. Idea for
the Consumer by himself to be able specify further-additional constraints, i.e. if
Phone No. has Protection of &#8221;...&#8221;, then Consumer may wish to make it more strict to
specific format.<br />
JS in CPI does not have unified-consistant checks for end user (or Consumer)
&#8221;Browser&#8221; Program, i.e.<br />
&#8221;navigator.appName;&#8221;<br />
&#8221;navigator.appVersion;&#8221;<br />
&#8221;navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf(&#8217;safari&#8217;)&#8221;<br />
                                                                  

                                                                  
By look at Ref. https://www.w3schools.com/js/js&#x02D9;window&#x02D9;navigator.asp best option
would be to check &#8221;navigator.userAgent&#8221; and get all the needed data from there.
When there exists Internet full of Open Source Browser Apps, the data in
&#8221;navigator.appName&#8221; and &#8221;navigator.appVersion&#8221; are not releable Option at all,
unless if there would be some ISO Standard who would link specific Company
Program to Specific App Name. Nowadays we have a lot of Standard Offering
Companies too, so more easiest example could be Specific Community maintained
Database which would have/has support by most of specific &#8221;Browser&#8221; App
Creators.<br />
JS code would be more safe, if there would be centralised checks like in previous
reference, i.e.:<br />
navigator.cookieEnabled;<br />
navigator.javaEnabled();<br />
navigator.onLine;<br />
what about other technologies/pre-processors/current status?<br />
Strange Things would be to find something like following (in JS code):<br />
&#8221;[S(&#8221;&#8220;WEP1&#8220;&#8221;), 0]&#8221;<br />
&#8221;[S(&#8221;&#8220;WEP2&#8220;&#8221;), 1]&#8221;<br />
&#8221;[S(&#8221;&#8220;WEP3&#8220;&#8221;), 2]&#8221;<br />
&#8221;[S(&#8221;&#8220;WEP4&#8220;&#8221;), 3]&#8221;<br />
Parallel understanding via different languages (EN, Chinese...) and security
functionality and technologies in Practice are in Question?<br />
WEP is less secure than WPA, WPA2.<br />
WEP is more secure that No Authentication.<br />
WEP currently could not be selected via CPI.<br />
If there were official WEP update in more secure option, then I would wish to have
for such knowledge.<br />
CPI is Powered by jQuery of First Major version 1.X. According ref.
https://releases.jquery.com/jquery/ there are already Third Major version 3.X
[jQuery]<br />
CPI from Admin Settings allows to reset CPI into Factory Defaults.<br />
Wired Network in automatic fashion sets up only IPv4, but there should be way to
set up IPv6 too. [Set Up of IPv6]<br />
Each Query of CPI expires in the Past as &#8221;Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT&#8221;.<br />
Server in Responses provides Cache Setting as &#8221;no-cache&#8221; for the Browser to comply.
[Bad Practice]<br />
CPI does not use Security Measures like HTTP Strict Transport Security, Public Key
Pinning, Content Security Policy. [Security Headers]<br />
CPI are providing twelve (12) choises for language selection. Idea for the Consumer
to provide these languages as set of two values where first would be shown in Original
language as in current situation and for second one - according default locale and (or)
some Admin Setting. [Idea]<br />
CPI has good Security Option for letting Consumers to prolong their CPI&#8217;s Security
of the HTTPS protocol by generating new Self-signed Certs.<br />
If we are taking in the Account that Self-signed Certificate valid not earlier than
2019-09-11 EES, then after around up to 4-5 Years from this date using
                                                                  

                                                                  
&#8221;Public-Key: (2048 bit)&#8221; Certificate would be good to conduct-issue new
Cert.<br />
Unfortunately there no Option to choose &#8221;Public-Key: (4096 bit)&#8221; which could be
valid a bit longer. [OpenSSL]<br />
And a lil more. [2nd and 3rd Idea]<br />

<!--l. 191--><p class="noindent" >OpenSSL Setup (Annex. A) with password protected certificate were impossible to
deploy in Raspberry Pi 3 B+ default 2.4 Apache Web Server. In other words 1)
enabling and linking SSL in the Web Server, then 2) trying to start the Server and
the Apache HTTP Server does not understand how to get the passphrase(password)
input from &#8221;Admin&#8221; and (or) User.<br />
                                                                  

                                                                  
Bitnami LAMP Stack 7.X in Ubuntu (as PANTUM drivers System for Ubuntu
exists) has pretty LAMP Graphical User Interface from which is impossible to launch
the Server, because the HTTP Server does not understand how to get the
passphrase(password) input from &#8221;Admin&#8221; and (or) User. OpenSSL library itself has
bad reputation with IoT small-size Computers and regular Computers because it
does not provide &#8221;Security View&#8221; situation for getting to know how well specific
algorithm are able to perform in current hardware instrument, so it would not hang
the System itself. At least expected to read &#8221;Diagnostics Status&#8221; for assessment how
well OpenSSL lib fahren.
